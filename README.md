# Website Challenge

## Planning 

After reading through the requirements of the task I had a discussion with my client to see what her ideal website would be like. She provided me with some written content, highlighting what was important for her to convey on her website. We considered how her content would be presented to meet the needs of the users. 
I assessed what we could fit into a one page website and with her input decided what parts were important to include. We had a list of colour palettes, style ideas and content. We discussed things like accessibility and content layout. We made a task list to ensure timely execution of the project. I had daily check-ins with the client to ensure that I donâ€™t lose sight of her requirements and take onboard any new feedback. 


## User research and accessibility

When I had a clear indication of what my client wanted we moved on to the next stage of user research. We created a survey to get a better idea of what the users viewed as important on a website. This allowed me to leave out content that was deemed unimportant by the most.  Some of the things users wanted to see on the website included-

* A navigation bar
* A picture of the client
* A comment on goals/why School of Code?
* Hobbies

The user research survey also allowed me to narrow down the colour palette and helped guide the styling of the website
We also received valuable insight from our team members who were able to view our website and provide real time advice. The feedback from the users, the client and our team was really vital in considering things like accessibility, styling and content.
To meet accessibility needs I ensured font sizes and colours were ideal, I included a navigation bar to allow users to navigate to important sections. To make sure that users are able to find answers to anything that may have been missed out and give them the opportunity to learn more about the client I included links to her youtube video, her github account and her email. 

## Outcome
 
 Through research, pair work and the resources provided I was able to create a simple website that the client was happy with. It was a great way to learn new skills and incoporate what we have covered in the past two weeks. Rebecca was an amazing person to be paired with and I have learnt a lot from working alongside her.
